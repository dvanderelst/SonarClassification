  abstract      = {Bats that capture animal prey from substrates often emit characteristic echolocation calls that are short-duration, frequency-modulated (FM) and broadband. Such calls seem to be suited to locating prey in uncluttered habitats, including flying prey, but may be less effective for finding prey among cluttered backgrounds because echoes reflecting from the substrate mask the acoustic signature of prey. Perhaps these call designs serve primarily for spatial orientation. Furthermore, it has been unclear whether the acoustic image conveyed by FM echoes enables fine texture discrimination, or whether gleaning bats that forage in echo-cluttering environments must locate prey by using other cues, such as prey-generated sounds. Here we show that two species of insectivorous gleaning bats perform badly when compelled to detect silent and immobile prey in clutter, but are very efficient at capturing noisy prey items among highly cluttered backgrounds, and both dead or live prey in uncluttered habitats. These findings suggest that the short, broadband FM echolocation calls associated with gleaning bats are not adapted to detecting prey in clutter.},

This claim has been based on improved performance with acronyms in the Reicher-Wheeler task, the letter string matching task, the visual feature integration task, and the N400 component in event-related potential (ERP) studies. Unfortunately, in all these tasks performance on acronyms resembled performance on pseudowords more than performance on words. To further assess the similarity of acronyms and words, we focused on the meaning of the acronyms and used masked priming to examine whether target words can be primed to the same extent with associatively related acronyms as with associatively related words. Such priming was possible at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 84 ms. In addition, the priming of the acronyms did not depend on the letter case in which they were presented: The target word "books" was primed as much by isbn and iSbN as by ISBN.},

  abstract        = {A wide variety of insects use spatial memories in behaviours like holding a position in air or flowing water, in returning to a place of safety, and in foraging. The Hymenoptera, in particular, have evolved life-histories requiring reliable spatial memories to support the task of provisioning their young. Behavioural experiments, primarily on social bees and ants, reveal the mechanisms by which these memories are employed for guidance to spatial goals and suggest how the memories, and the processing streams that use them, may be organized. We discuss three types of memory-based guidance which, together, can explain a large part of observed insect spatial behaviour. Two of these, alignment image-matching and positional image-matching, are based on an insect's remembered views of its surroundings: The first uses views to keep to a familiar heading and the second to head towards a familiar place. The third type of guidance is based on a process of path integration by which an insect monitors its distance and direction from its nest through odometric and compass information. To a large degree, these guidance mechanisms appear to involve modular computational systems. We discuss the lack of evidence for cognitive maps in insects, and in particular the evidence against a map based on path integration, in which view-based and path integration memories might be combined. We suggest instead that insects have a collective of separate guidance systems, which cooperate and train each other, and together provide reliable guidance over a range of conditions.},

  abstract      = { <title>Author Summary</title> <p>When desert ants search for food, they often have to travel over long distances, more then ten thousand times their body lengths and then turn back to find the nest entrance. It is known from many experiments that these animals employ a skylight compass including the sun, a pedometer, and a mechanism called path integration. This means that during walking they continuously update the vector pointing from their actual position back to the nest site. In addition they use landmarks. However, based on observations of the behaviour of ants and honey bees several authors have argued that these animals finally employ a neural system that is able to represent frequently visited locations in the form of a map (a ?cognitive map?). Having a map-like system available would allow the animal to find a shortcut between two separately learned locations without having learned this direct path between both locations beforehand. As such shortcuts have been observed, cognitive maps have been assumed to exist. Here we show in a simulation study based on artificial neural networks that shortcuts as observed in the experiments are also possible with a memory system using a completely decentralized architecture not including an explicit cognitive map.</p> },

  abstract      = {A lexical decision experiment with Dutch-English bilinguals compared the effect of word frequency on visual word recognition in the first language with that in the second language. Bilinguals showed a considerably larger frequency effect in their second language, even though corpus frequency was matched across languages. Experiment 2 tested monolingual, native speakers of English on the English materials from Experiment 1. This yielded a frequency effect comparable to that of the bilinguals in Dutch (their L1). These results constrain the way in which existing models of word recognition can be extended to unbalanced bilingualism. In particular, the results are compatible with a theory by which the frequency effect originates from implicit learning. They are also compatible with models that attribute frequency effects to serial search in frequency-ordered bins (Murray & Forster, 2004), if these models are extended with the assumption that scanning speed is language dependent, or that bins are not language specific.},

  abstract      = {A computational sensorimotor model of target capture behavior by the echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus, was developed to understand the detection, localization, tracking, and interception of insect prey in a biological sonar system. This model incorporated acoustics, target localization processes, flight aerodynamics, and target capture planning to produce model trajectories replicating those observed in behavioral insect capture trials. Estimates of target range were based on echo delay, azimuth on the relative intensity of the echo at the two ears, and elevation on the spectral pattern of the sonar return in a match/mismatch process. Flapping flight aerodynamics was used to produce realistic model trajectories. Localization in all three spatial dimensions proved necessary to control target tracking and interception for an adequate model of insect capture behavior by echolocating bats. Target capture using maneuvering flight was generally successful when the model's path was controlled by a planning process that made use of an anticipatory internal simulation, while simple homing was successful only for targets directly ahead of the model bat.},

The azimuthal position of the axis of highest pinna gain came closer to the midsagital plane with increasing frequency. The acoustic axis of highest pinna gain was further characterized by an increase of the elevation angle with increasing frequency and a specific decrease at 55 kHz. Additionally, a spectral notch separated two regions of high and low frequency hearing at specific elevation and frequency combinations. The special influence of the tragus on the position of the pinna gain axis and the spectral notches is demonstrated. The functional implications of the spectral notch for hearing in P. discolor are discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Neurobiological and neuroethological findings on insects can be used to design and construct small robots controlling their navigation on the basis of bio-inspired visual strategies and circuits. Animals' visual guidance is partly mediated by motion-sensitive neurons, which are responsible for gauging the optic flow. Although neurons of this kind were discovered in vertebrates' and invertebrates' visual systems more than 50 years ago, the principles and neural mechanisms involved have not yet been completely elucidated. Here, first, I propose to outline some of the findings we made during the last few decades by performing electrophysiological recordings on identified neurons in the housefly's eye while applying optical stimulation to identified photoreceptors. Whereas these findings shed light on the inner processing structure of an elementary motion detector (EMD), recent studies in which the latest genetic and neuroanatomical methods were applied to the fruitfly's visual system have identified some of the neurons in the visual chain which are possibly involved in the neural circuitry underlying a given EMD. Then, I will describe some of the proof-of-concept robots that we have developed on the basis of our biological findings. The 100-g robot OCTAVE, for example, is able to avoid the ground, react to wind, and land autonomously on a flat terrain without ever having to measure any state variables such as distances or speeds. The 100-g robots OSCAR 1 and OSCAR 2 inspired by the microscanner we discovered in the housefly's eye are able to stabilize their body using mainly visual means and track a moving edge with hyperacuity. These robots react to the optic flow, which is sensed by miniature optic flow sensors inspired by the housefly's EMDs. Constructing a {\textquotedblleft}biorobot{\textquotedblright} gives us a unique opportunity of checking the soundness and robustness of a principle that is initially thought to be understood by bringing it face to face with the real physic- l world. Bio-inspired robotics not only help neurobiologists and neuroethologists to identify and investigate worthwhile problems in animals' sensory-motor systems, but they also provide engineers with ideas for developing novel devices and machines with promising future applications, in the field of smart autonomous vehicles and microvehicles, for example.},

  abstract      = {Ears evolved in many nocturnal insects, including some moths, to detect bat echolocation calls and evade capture [1, 2]. Although there is evidence that some bats emit echolocation calls that are inconspicuous to eared moths, it is difficult to determine whether this was an adaptation to moth hearing or originally evolved for a different purpose [2, 3]. Aerial-hawking bats generally emit high-amplitude echolocation calls to maximize detection range [4, 5]. Here we present the first example of an echolocation counterstrategy to overcome prey hearing at the cost of reduced detection distance. We combined comparative bat flight-path tracking and moth neurophysiology with fecal DNA analysis to show that the barbastelle, Barbastella barbastellus, emits calls that are 10 to 100 times lower in amplitude than those of other aerial-hawking bats, remains undetected by moths until close, and captures mainly eared moths. Model calculations demonstrate that only bats emitting such low-amplitude calls hear moth echoes before their calls are conspicuous to moths. This stealth echolocation allows the barbastelle to exploit food resources that are difficult to catch for other aerial-hawking bats emitting calls of greater amplitude.},

  abstract      = {Through echolocation, a bat can perceive not only the position of an object in the dark; it can also recognize its 3D structure. A tree, however, is a very complex object; it has thousands of reflective surfaces that result in a chaotic acoustic image of the tree. Technically, the acoustic image of an object is its impulse response (IR), i.e., the sum of the reflections recorded when the object is ensonified with an acoustic impulse. The extraction of the acoustic IR from the ultrasonic echo and the detailed IR analysis underlies the bats' extraordinary object-recognition capabilities. Here, a phantom-object playback experiment is developed to demonstrate that the bat Phyllostomus discolor can evaluate a statistical property of chaotic IRs, the IR roughness. The IRs of the phantom objects consisted of up to 4,000 stochastically distributed reflections. It is shown that P. discolor spontaneously classifies echoes generated with these IRs according to IR roughness. This capability enables the bats to evaluate complex natural textures, such as foliage types, in a meaningful manner. The present behavioral results and their simulations in a computer model of the bats' ascending auditory system indicate the involvement of modulation-sensitive neurons in echo analysis.},

Thickenings of the pars pectinata and pars tecta are well developed in Pteronotus; they show no sudden changes in their dimensions and in this way differ from the thickenings found in the European horseshoe bat whose sharply tuned sense of hearing seems at least partially dependent on sudden, marked changes in the structure of the basilar membrane. In Pteronotus the greater part of the basilar membrane, 7.5 mm or approximately 58\%, lies within the enormous basal turn and within this turn there are steeply banked curves and one small 0.5-mm region where the membrane is straight. The straight portion is associated with a region of the cochlea where there is a marked change in the density of nerve fibers and where the stria vascularis, spiral ligament and fluid-filled spaces of the ear are enlarged.},

Secondly, perception can be simulated by internal activation of sensory cortex in a way that resembles its normal activation during perception of external stimuli. The third assumption ('anticipation') is that both overt and simulated actions can elicit perceptual simulation of their most probable consequences. A large body of evidence, mainly from neuroimaging studies, that supports these assumptions, is reviewed briefly. The theory is ontologically parsimonious and does not rely on standard cognitivist constructs such as internal models or representations. It is argued that the simulation approach can explain the relations between motor, sensory and cognitive functions and the appearance of an inner world. It also unifies and explains important features of a wide variety of cognitive phenomena such as memory and cognitive maps. Novel findings from recent developments in memory research on the similarity of imaging and memory and on the role of both prefrontal cortex and sensory cortex in declarative memory and working memory are predicted by the theory and provide striking support for it.

By ultrastructural (TEM and SEM) and biochemical analyses it was found that individual bundles of the net are similar to elastic ligaments. Although elastic fibres predominate, they are integrated and aligned in parallel with small bundles of collagen. A reticulum of fibroblasts, joined by focal junctions, forms a cellular framework throughout each bundle. Because of the unique features of the fibre bundles of the bat's wing, in particular their accessibility, and the parallel alignment of the collagen fibrils and elastic fibres in each easily isolatable fibre bundle, they should prove a most valuable model for connective tissue studies, particularly for the study of collagen-elastin interactions.},

  abstract      = {Bats have been extensively studied with regard to their ability to orient, navigate and hunt prey by means of echolocation, but almost nothing is known about how they orient and navigate in situations such as migration and homing outside the range of their echolocation system. As volant animals, bats face many of the same problems and challenges as birds. Migrating bats must relocate summer and winter home ranges over distances as far as 2,000 km. Foraging bats must be able to relocate their home roost if they range beyond a familiar area, and indeed circumstan tial evidence suggests that these animals can home from more than 600 km. However, an extensive research program on homing and navigation in bats halted in the early 1970s. The field of bird navigation has advanced greatly since that time and many of the mechanisms that birds are known to use for navigation were not known or widely accepted at this time. In this paper I discuss what is known about orientation and navigation in bats and use bird navigation as a model for future research in bat navigation. Technology is advancing such that previous difficulties in studying orientation in bats in the field can be overcome and so that the mechanisms of navigation in this highly mobile animal can finally be elucidated.},

In bats that use echolocation to find prey in darkness, it is not clear whether the specialized diet, as sometimes found by faecal analysis, is a result of active decision-making or rather of biased sensory information. Here, we tested whether greater horseshoe bats decide economically when to attack a particular prey item and when not. This species is known to recognize different insects based on their wing-beat pattern imprinted in the echoes. We built a simulation of the natural foraging process in the laboratory, where the bats scanned for prey from a perch and, upon reaching the decision to attack, intercepted the prey in flight. To fully control echo information available to the bats and assure its unambiguity, we implemented computer-controlled propellers that produced echoes resembling those from natural insects of differing profitability. The bats monitored prey arrivals to sample the supply of prey categories in the environment and to inform foraging decisions. The bats adjusted selectivity for the more profitable prey to its inter-arrival intervals as predicted by foraging theory (an economic strategy known to benefit fitness). Moreover, unlike in previously studied vertebrates, foraging performance of horseshoe bats was not limited by costly rejections of the profitable prey. This calls for further research into the evolutionary selection pressures that sharpened the species's decision-making capacity.},

This model indicates that successful nonpredictive tracking of an ideal prey can be accomplished with a very simple system. Circular apertures approximate the mouth and ears for deriving acoustic beam patterns, using the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus as a model. Fundamental and overtone frequency components in the emissions allow two simultaneous acoustic beams to be defined. A pair of nonlinear, time-variable, sampled-data controllers alter the bat's heading by applying yaw and pitch heading corrections. The yaw correction attempts to position the prey in the midsagittal plane by nulling the interaural intensity difference of the fundamental component. The pitch correction compares the intensities of the overtone and fundamental components and acts to null their difference. By initiating pitch correction when the overtone intensity first exceeds that of the fundamental, the ambiguity problem is solved and the prey is directed to the capture region. Simulations of passive prey capture indicate that the capture probability decreases as the prey speed increases. Both quick and sluggish prey are considered, with sluggish prey found to be caught with slightly better efficiency. The magnitude of the prey's lateral motion just prior to capture is observed to be an important factor determining capture. The presence of a blind stage is considered, during which the interference of the emission with the echo is assumed to disrupt any sonar information. The presence of such a blind stage is found to have negligible effect on capture efficiency.},

This acuity depends upon modification of sounds entering the external ear canal by the structures of the external ear. Deflection of the tragus degrades the acuity of vertical-angle perception from 3 degrees to about 12 degrees to 14 degrees. The pinna-tragus structure produces a strong secondary echo of sounds entering the external ear canal, and the delay of this echo after the time when the sound directly enters the ear canal apparently encodes the vertical direction of a sound source.},

  abstract      = {1. Flights of three big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) landing on a hand and catching a suspended mealworm were video analysed. 2. Results were consistent with the bats using the same basic control procedure in the quite different approach tasks--namely keeping tau (r) = kr and tau (a)/tau (r) = k alpha r. Here r is the current distance to the destination; alpha is the angle between the current direction of the destination and the goal direction of final approach (beta min); tau (r) = r/r, tau (alpha) = alpha/alpha; and kr, k alpha r are constants. 3. The bats were each quite consistent on a particular task (hand or mealworm) in the values they used for the control parameters kr, k alpha r and beta min. However, different values were used in the two tasks, which reflected the different behaviour required at the destination. Flights to hand required twisting and landing upside down and approach angle beta min was closer to vertical and kr was smaller and corresponded to decelerating nearly to a stop. In contrast, the mealworms were caught in mid flight and approach angle beta min was shallower and speed of approach was about constant. 4. tau (r) might be registered acoustically by tau (echo-delay) or by tau (echo-intensity). tau (alpha) might be registered by the bat's directional hearing and gravity sense. 5. The bat's learned the tasks easily, suggesting that the control procedure they used in the experiments was part and parcel of the natural skills they had developed in the wild.},

To mimic this aerial prowess in a similarly sized robot requires tiny, high-efficiency mechanical components that pose miniaturization challenges governed by force-scaling laws, suggesting unconventional solutions for propulsion, actuation, and manufacturing. To this end, we developed high-power-density piezoelectric flight muscles and a manufacturing methodology capable of rapidly prototyping articulated, flexure-based sub-millimeter mechanisms. We built an 80-milligram, insect-scale, flapping-wing robot modeled loosely on the morphology of flies. Using a modular approach to flight control that relies on limited information about the robot's dynamics, we demonstrated tethered but unconstrained stable hovering and basic controlled flight maneuvers. The result validates a sufficient suite of innovations for achieving artificial, insect-like flight.},

  abstract      = {Echolocating bats transmit ultrasonic vocalizations and use information contained in the reflected sounds to analyze the auditory scene. Auditory scene analysis, a phenomenon that applies broadly to all hearing vertebrates, involves the grouping and segregation of sounds to perceptually organize information about auditory objects. The perceptual organization of sound is influenced by the spectral and temporal characteristics of acoustic signals. In the case of the echolocating bat, its active control over the timing, duration, intensity, and bandwidth of sonar transmissions directly impacts its perception of the auditory objects that comprise the scene. Here, data are presented from perceptual experiments, laboratory insect capture studies, and field recordings of sonar behavior of different bat species, to illustrate principles of importance to auditory scene analysis by echolocation in bats. In the perceptual experiments, FM bats (Eptesicus fuscus) learned to discriminate between systematic and random delay sequences in echo playback sets. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the FM bat can assemble information about echo delay changes over time, a requirement for the analysis of a dynamic auditory scene. Laboratory insect capture experiments examined the vocal production patterns of flying E. fuscus taking tethered insects in a large room. In each trial, the bats consistently produced echolocation signal groups with a relatively stable repetition rate (within 5\%). Similar temporal patterning of sonar vocalizations was also observed in the field recordings from E. fuscus, thus suggesting the importance of temporal control of vocal production for perceptually guided behavior. It is hypothesized that a stable sonar signal production rate facilitates the perceptual organization of echoes arriving from objects at different directions and distances as the bat flies through a dynamic auditory scene. Field recordings of E. fuscus, Noctilio albiventris, N. leporinus, Pippistrellus pippistrellus, and Cormura brevirostris revealed that spectral adjustments in sonar signals may also be important to permit tracking of echoes in a complex auditory scene.},

  abstract      = {Echolocating bats can be divided into guilds according to their preferred habitat and foraging behaviour, which coincide with distinct adaptations in wing morphology and structure of echolocation signals. Although coarse structuring of niche space between different guilds is generally accepted, it is not clear how niches differ within guilds, or whether there is fine-grained niche differentiation reflected in echolocation signal structure. Using a standardized performance test, here we show clutter-dependent differences in prey-capture success for bats from five species of European Myotis. These species are morphologically similar, sympatric, and all belong to the guild labelled "edge space aerial/trawling foragers". We further demonstrate a strong correlation between the prey-detection ability of the species and the respective search-call bandwidth. Our findings indicate that differences in echolocation signals contribute to within-guild niche differentiation. This is the first study relating sensory abilities of a set of potentially competing animal species to a direct measure of their respective foraging performance, suggesting an important role of sensory ecology in the structuring of animal communities.},

Individual auditory neurons are frequency-tuned and respond to brief, 2-10. ms FM sweeps with an average of one spike per sound to register their tuned frequencies, to detect echo arrival, or to register a local null in the echo spectrum. When initiated by the broadcast, these responses comprise a cascade of single spikes distributed across time in neurons tuned to different frequencies that persists for 30-50. ms, long after the sound has ended. Their progress mirrors the broadcast's propagation away from the bat and the return of echoes for distances out to 5-8. m. Each returning echo evokes a similar pattern of single spikes that coincide with ongoing responses to the broadcast to register the target's distance and shape. The hypothesis advanced here is that this flow of responses over time acts as an internal model of sonar acoustics that the bat executes using neuronal computations distributed across many neurons to accumulate a dynamic image of the bat's surroundings. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract      = {Echolocating bats of the speciesEptesicus fuscus were trained to discriminate between two arrays of vertical rods differing in the size of the angle in the horizontal plane separating the rods in each array. With both two-rod arrays and fiverod arrays the bats were able to distinguish angular differences as small as 1.5 °(75% correct-response threshold). The similarity of the results obtained with both array sizes shows that the angular separation of adjacent rods, and not the width of the array as a whole in the case of five-rod arrays, is the source of cues for the discrimination. Acoustic control experiments were carried out to determine whether echoes reflecting laterally from one rod to another contributed cues to the bat. The results indicate that discrimination was based on the bat's perception of the horizontal angular position of each rod relative to its neighbors, and not upon acoustic interactions among the rods. The acuity of horizontal-angle discrimination measured at 1.5 ° may represent the acuity with which the bat's sonar system processes echoes to display one target's azimuth relative to the azimuth of another target. The results thus may represent the acuity of discrimination of target location by the binaural mechanisms of localization of sound. Although bats are considered to have heads that are too small for producing adequate interaural arrival-time cues for sound localization, the extremely broad bandwidth of FM echolocation signals and echoes may compensate for small interaural separation in bats. It is, therefore, most provocative that the observed performance ofEptesicus fuscus at horizontal-angle discrimination matches the performance to be expected if the 0.5 microseconds acuity of perception of the time-of-occurrence of sonar echoes measured in echo-jitter experiments can be applied to binaural echo arrivaltime perception. It cannot be ruled out that the FM bat compares the arrival time of echoes at the two ears and reconstructs in some manner the relative phase of these sounds to determine target direction in the horizontal plane.},

The particular shape, slope and depth of such image difference functions (IDFs) recorded at any one place, however, depend on a number of factors that so far have only been qualitatively identified. Here we show how the shape of difference functions depends on the depth structure and the contrast of natural scenes, by quantifying the depth- distribution of different outdoor scenes and by comparing it to the difference functions calculated with differently processed panoramic images, which were recorded at the same locations. We find (1) that IDFs and catchment areas become systematically wider as the average distance of objects increases, (2) that simple image processing operations -- like subtracting the local mean, difference-of-Gaussian filtering and local contrast normalization -- make difference functions robust against changes in illumination and the spurious effects of shadows, and (3) by comparing depth-dependent translational and depth-independent rotational difference functions, we show that IDFs of contrast-normalized snapshots are predominantly determined by the depth-structure and possibly also by occluding contours in a scene. We propose a model for the shape of IDFs as a tool for quantitative comparisons between the shapes of these functions in different scenes.},

  abstract      = {Anthropogenic disturbance is a major cause of worldwide declines in biodiversity. Understanding the implications of this disturbance for species and populations is crucial for conservation biologists wishing to mitigate negative effects. Anthropogenic light pollution is an increasing global problem, affecting ecological interactions across a range of taxa and impacting negatively upon critical animal behaviors including foraging, reproduction, and communication (for review see). Almost all bats are nocturnal, making them ideal subjects for testing the effects of light pollution. Previous studies have shown that bat species adapted to foraging in open environments feed on insects attracted to mercury vapor lamps. Here, we use an experimental approach to provide the first evidence of a negative effect of artificial light pollution on the commuting behavior of a threatened bat species. We installed high-pressure sodium lights that mimic the intensity and light spectra of streetlights along commuting routes of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Bat activity was reduced dramatically and the onset of commuting behavior was delayed in the presence of lighting, with no evidence of habituation. These results demonstrate that light pollution may have significant negative impacts upon the selection of flight routes by bats.},

  abstract      = {Many studies have assessed the level of bed net coverage in populations at risk of malaria infection. These revealed large variations in bed net use across countries, regions and social strata. Such studies are often aimed at identifying populations with low access to bed nets that should be prioritized in future interventions. However, often spatial differences in malaria endemicity are not taken into account. By ignoring variability in malaria endemicity, these studies prioritize populations with little access to bed nets, even if these happen to live in low endemicity areas. Conversely, populations living in regions with high malaria endemicity will receive a lower priority once a seizable proportion is protected by bed nets. Adequately assigning priorities requires accounting for both the current level of bed net coverage and the local malaria endemicity. Indeed, as shown here for 23 African countries, there is no correlation between the level of bed net coverage and the level of malaria endemicity in a region. Therefore, the need for future interventions can not be assessed based on current bed net coverage alone. This paper proposes the Adjusted Bed net Coverage (ABC) statistic as a measure taking into account both local malaria endemicity and the level of bed net coverage. The measure allows setting priorities for future interventions taking into account both local malaria endemicity and bed net coverage.A mathematical formulation of the ABC as a weighted difference of bed net coverage and malaria endemicity is presented. The formulation is parameterized based on a model of malaria epidemiology (Smith et al. Trends Parasitol 25:511-516, 2009). By parameterizing the ABC based on this model, the ABC as used in this paper is proxy for the steady-state malaria burden given the current level of bed net coverage. Data on the bed net coverage in under five year olds and malaria endemicity in 23 Sub-Saharan countries is used to show that the ABC prioritizes different populations than the level of bed net coverage by itself. Data from the following countries was used: Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo Democratic Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The priority order given by the ABC and the bed net coverage are compared at the countries' level, the first level administrative divisions and for five different wealth quintiles.Both at national level and at the level of the administrative divisions the ABC suggests a different priority order for selecting countries and divisions for future interventions. When taking into account malaria endemicity, measures assessing equality in access to bed nets across wealth quintiles, such as slopes of inequality, are prone to change. This suggests that when assessing inequality in access to bed nets one should take into account the local malaria endemicity for populations from different wealth quintiles.Accounting for malaria endemicity highlights different countries, regions and socio-economic strata for future intervention than the bed net coverage by itself. Therefore, care should be taken to factor out any effects of local malaria endemicity in assessing bed net coverage and in prioritizing populations for further scale-up of bed net coverage. The ABC is proposed as a simple means to do this that is derived from an existing model of malaria epidemiology.},

To investigate whether these characteristics are due to cochlear properties, we recorded distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and calculated relative DPOAE threshold curves, which proved to be a good measure of cochlear sensitivity. Our results indicate that in P. discolor, cochlear sensitivity, as assessed by DPOAE recordings, does not show a threshold maximum at 55 kHz. The DPOAE threshold curves display an absolute minimum at approximately 30 kHz, and from that frequency region, the threshold continuously increases without any pronounced irregularities. The frequency tuning properties of the cochlea, as assessed by DPOAE suppression tuning curves (STCs) reveal broad filter bandwidths with Q10dB values between 3.4 and 10.7. There are no frequency-specific specializations of cochlear tuning. The characteristic pattern of subsequent threshold maxima and minima at high frequencies observed in behavioral studies seems to be shaped by transfer characteristics of the outer ear and/or neuronal processing in the ascending auditory pathway rather than by cochlear mechanics.},

  abstract      = {Animals have needed to find their way about almost since a free-living life style evolved. Particularly, if an animal has a home--shelter or nesting site--true navigation becomes necessary to shuttle between this home and areas of other activities, such as feeding. As old as navigation is in the animal kingdom, as diverse are its mechanisms and implementations, depending on an organism's ecology and its endowment with sensors and actuators. The use of landmarks for piloting or the use of trail pheromones for route following have been examined in great detail and in a variety of animal species. The same is true for senses of direction--the compasses for navigation--and the construction of vectors for navigation from compass and distance cues. The measurement of distance itself--odometry--has received much less attention. The present review addresses some recent progress in the understanding of odometers in invertebrates, after outlining general principles of navigation to put odometry in its proper context. Finally, a number of refinements that increase navigation accuracy and safety are addressed.},

  abstract      = {The paper discusses robot navigation from biological inspiration. The authors sought to build a model of the rodent brain that is suitable for practical robot navigation. The core model, dubbed RatSLAM, has been demonstrated to have exactly the same advantages described earlier: it can build, maintain, and use maps simultaneously over extended periods of time and can construct maps of large and complex areas from very weak geometric information. The work contrasts with other efforts to embody models of rat brains in robots. The article describes the key elements of the known biology of the rat brain in relation to navigation and how the RatSLAM model captures the ideas from biology in a fashion suitable for implementation on a robotic platform. The paper then outline RatSLAM's performance in two difficult robot navigation challenges, demonstrating how a cognitive robotics approach to navigation can produce results that rival other state of the art approaches in robotics.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Insects are known to rely on terrestrial landmarks for navigation. Landmarks are used to chart a route or pinpoint a goal. The distant panorama, however, is often thought not to guide navigation directly during a familiar journey, but to act as a contextual cue that primes the correct memory of the landmarks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We provided Melophorus bagoti ants with a huge artificial landmark located right near the nest entrance to find out whether navigating ants focus on such a prominent visual landmark for homing guidance. When the landmark was displaced by small or large distances, ant routes were affected differently. Certain behaviours appeared inconsistent with the hypothesis that guidance was based on the landmark only. Instead, comparisons of panoramic images recorded on the field, encompassing both landmark and distal panorama, could explain most aspects of the ant behaviours.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Ants navigating along a familiar route do not focus on obvious landmarks or filter out distal panoramic cues, but appear to be guided by cues covering a large area of their panoramic visual field, including both landmarks and distal panorama. Using panoramic views seems an appropriate strategy to cope with the complexity of natural scenes and the poor resolution of insects' eyes. The ability to isolate landmarks from the rest of a scene may be beyond the capacity of animals that do not possess a dedicated object-perception visual stream like primates.},

We then asked whether the reference position can be pinpointed from a random starting position by moving the panoramic imaging device in such a way that the image differences relative to the reference image are minimized. We find that on time scales of minutes to hours, outdoor locations are accurately defined by a clear, sharp minimum in a smooth three-dimensional (3D) volume of image differences (the 3D difference function). 3D difference functions depend on the spatial-frequency content of natural scenes and on the spatial layout of objects therein. They become steeper in the vicinity of dominant objects. Their shape and smoothness, however, are affected by changes in illumination and shadows. The difference functions generated by rotation are similar in shape to those generated by translation, but their plateau values are higher. Rotational difference functions change little with distance from the reference location. Simple gradient descent methods are surprisingly successful in recovering a goal location, even if faced with transient changes in illumination. Our results show that view-based homing with panoramic images is in principle feasible in natural environments and does not require the identification of individual landmarks. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the study of robot and insect homing.},

We present evidence that this structure is similar to a labeled graph: a network of topological connections between places, labeled with local metric information. In contrast to route knowledge, we find that the most frequent routes and detours to target locations had not been traveled during learning. Contrary to purely topological knowledge, participants typically traveled the shortest metric distance to a target, rather than topologically equivalent but longer paths. The results are consistent with the proposal that people learn a labeled graph of their environment.},

There are, however, two main definitions. One, sensu Tolman, O'Keefe and Nadel, is that a cognitive map is a powerful memory of landmarks which allows novel short-cutting to occur. The other, sensu Gallistel, is that a cognitive map is any representation of space held by an animal. Other definitions with quite different meanings are also summarised. I argue that no animal has been conclusively shown to have a cognitive map, sensu Tolman, O'Keefe and Nadel, because simpler explanations of the crucial novel short-cutting results are invariably possible. Owing to the repeated inability of experimenters to eliminate these simpler explanations over at least 15 years, and the confusion caused by the numerous contradictory definitions of a cognitive map, I argue that the cognitive map is no longer a useful hypothesis for elucidating the spatial behaviour of animals and that use of the term should be avoided.},

  abstract        = {The rhythmic motor activity of the vibrissae that rodents use for the tactile localization of objects provides a model system for understanding patterned motor activity in mammals. The muscles that drive this whisking are only partially fixed relative to bony attachments and thus shift their position along with the movement. As a means to characterize the pattern of muscular dynamics during different patterns of whisking, we recorded electromyogram (EMG) activity from the muscles that propel individual follicles, as well as EMG activity from a muscle group that moves the mystacial pad. The dominant pattern of whisking in our behavioral paradigm, referred to as exploratory whisking, consisted of large amplitude sweeps in the frequency range of 5-15 Hz. The frequency remained remarkably constant within a bout of whisking but changed values between bouts. The extrinsic musculature, which shifts the surface of the pad backwards, was found to be activated in approximate antiphase to that of the intrinsic muscles, which rotate individual vibrissae forward. Thus retraction of the vibrissae was driven by a backward shift in the attachment point of the follicles to the mystacial pad. In a less frequent pattern of whisking, referred to as foveal whisking, the vibrissae are thrust forward and palpate objects with low-amplitude movements that are in the higher frequency range of 15-25 Hz. Protraction of the vibrissae remains driven by the intrinsic muscles, while retraction in this pattern is largely passive. Interestingly, a mechanical argument suggests that activation of the extrinsic muscles during foveal whisking is not expected to affect the angle of the vibrissae. As a means to establish if the phasic control of the intrinsic versus extrinsic muscles depended on sensory feedback, we characterized whisking before and after bilateral transections of the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal sensory nerve. The loss of sensory feedback had no net effect on the antiphase relation between activation of the intrinsic versus extrinsic muscles over the full frequency range for exploratory whisking. These data point to the existence of a dual-phase central pattern generator that drives the vibrissae.},

  abstract      = {Successful navigation is fundamental to the survival of nearly every animal on earth, and achieved by nervous systems of vastly different sizes and characteristics. Yet surprisingly little is known of the detailed neural circuitry from any species which can accurately represent space for navigation. Path integration is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous navigation strategies in the animal kingdom. Despite a plethora of computational models, from equational to neural network form, there is currently no consensus, even in principle, of how this important phenomenon occurs neurally. Recently, all path integration models were examined according to a novel, unifying classification system. Here we combine this theoretical framework with recent insights from directed walk theory, and develop an intuitive yet mathematically rigorous proof that only one class of neural representation of space can tolerate noise during path integration. This result suggests many existing models of path integration are not biologically plausible due to their intolerance to noise. This surprising result imposes significant computational limitations on the neurobiological spatial representation of all successfully navigating animals, irrespective of species. Indeed, noise-tolerance may be an important functional constraint on the evolution of neuroarchitectural plans in the animal kingdom.},

  abstract        = {Whisking mediated touch is an active sense whereby whisker movements are modulated by sensory input and behavioral context. Here we studied the effects of touching an object on whisking in head-fixed rats. Simultaneous movements of whiskers C1, C2, and D1 were tracked bilaterally and their movements compared. During free-air whisking, whisker protractions were typically characterized by a single acceleration-deceleration event, whisking amplitude and velocity were correlated, and whisk duration correlated with neither amplitude nor velocity. Upon contact with an object, a second acceleration-deceleration event occurred in about 25% of whisk cycles, involving both contacting (C2) and non-contacting (C1, D1) whiskers ipsilateral to the object. In these cases, the rostral whisker (C2) remained in contact with the object throughout the double-peak phase, which effectively prolonged the duration of C2 contact. These "touch-induced pumps" (TIPs) were detected, on average, 17.9 ms after contact. On a slower time scale, starting at the cycle following first touch, contralateral amplitude increased while ipsilateral amplitude decreased. Our results demonstrate that sensory-induced motor modulations occur at various timescales, and directly affect object palpation.},

  abstract        = {Animals actively regulate the position and movement of their sensory systems to boost the quality and quantity of the sensory information they obtain. The rat vibrissal system is recognized to be an important model system in which to investigate such "active sensing" capabilities. The current study used high-speed video analysis to investigate whisker movements in untrained, freely moving rats encountering unexpected, vertical surfaces. A prominent feature of rat vibrissal movement is the repeated posterior-anterior sweep of the whiskers in which the macrovibrissae are seen to move largely in synchrony. Here we show that a second significant component of whisking behavior is the size of the arc, or "spread," between the whiskers. Observed spread is shown to vary over the whisk cycle and to substantially decrease during exploration of an unexpected surface. We further show that the timing of whisker movements is affected by surface contact such that 1) the whiskers rapidly cease forward protraction following an initial, unexpected contact, and may do so even more rapidly following contact with the same surface in the subsequent whisk cycle, and 2) retraction velocity is reduced following this latter contact, leading to longer second-contact durations. This evidence is taken to support two hypotheses: 1) that the relative velocities of different whiskers may be actively controlled by the rat and 2) that control of whisker velocity and timing may serve to increase the number and duration of whisker-surface contacts while ensuring that such contacts are made with a light touch.},

  abstract        = {While the role of magnetic cues for compass orientation has been confirmed in numerous animals, the mechanism of detection is still debated. Two hypotheses have been proposed, one based on a light dependent mechanism, apparently used by birds and another based on a "compass organelle" containing the iron oxide particles magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)). Bats have recently been shown to use magnetic cues for compass orientation but the method by which they detect the Earth's magnetic field remains unknown. Here we use the classic "Kalmijn-Blakemore" pulse re-magnetization experiment, whereby the polarity of cellular magnetite is reversed. The results demonstrate that the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus uses single domain magnetite to detect the Earths magnetic field and the response indicates a polarity based receptor. Polarity detection is a prerequisite for the use of magnetite as a compass and suggests that big brown bats use magnetite to detect the magnetic field as a compass. Our results indicate the possibility that sensory cells in bats contain freely rotating magnetite particles, which appears not to be the case in birds. It is crucial that the ultrastructure of the magnetite containing magnetoreceptors is described for our understanding of magnetoreception in animals.},

  abstract      = {When humans use vision to gauge the travel distance of an extended forward movement, they often underestimate the movement's extent. This underestimation can be explained by leaky path integration, an integration of the movement to obtain distance. Distance underestimation occurs because this integration is imperfect and contains a leak that increases with distance traveled. We asked human observers to estimate the distance from a starting location for visually simulated movements in a virtual environment. The movements occurred along curved paths that veered left and right around a central forward direction. In this case, the distance that has to be integrated (i.e., the beeline distance between origin and endpoint) and the distance that is traversed (the path length along the curve) are distinct. We then tested whether the leak accumulated with distance from the origin or with traversed distance along the curved path. Leaky integration along the path makes the seemingly counterintuitive prediction that the estimated origin-to-endpoint distance should decrease with increasing veering, because the length of the path over which the integration occurs increases, leading to a larger leak effect. The results matched the prediction: movements of identical origin-to-endpoint distance were judged as shorter when the path became longer. We conclude that leaky path integration from visual motion is performed along the traversed path even when a straight beeline distance is calculated.},

This approximation is characterized by small, but systematic, navigational errors that helped us elucidate the ant's way of computing its mean home vector.},

The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to review four important models of path integration, analysing how the different models have evolved as a result of the authors' particular focus; second, to assess what they have brought to the understanding of path integration. The more specific the model, the less it will be possible to apply it to different situations; the more general its nature, the less adequately it will represent the details of the behaviour to be modelled. In this context, the paper discusses how the authors envisioned the role of homing errors. The usefulness and limits of the different perspectives is discussed, in particular how well the models fit with observations. Finally, ways of improving and developing the modelling process are proposed.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

  abstract      = {Path integration enables desert arthropods to find back to their nest on the shortest track from any position. To perform path integration successfully, speeds and turning angles along the preceding outbound path have to be measured continuously and combined to determine an internal global vector leading back home at any time. A number of experiments have given an idea how arthropods might use allothetic or idiothetic signals to perceive their orientation and moving speed. We systematically review the four possible model descriptions of mathematically precise path integration, whereby we favour and elaborate the hitherto not used variant of egocentric cartesian coordinates. Its simple and intuitive structure is demonstrated in comparison to the other models. Measuring two speeds, the forward moving speed and the angular turning rate, and implementing them into a linear system of differential equations provides the necessary information during outbound route, reorientation process and return path. In addition, we propose several possible types of systematic errors that can cause deviations from the correct homeward course. Deviations have been observed for several species of desert arthropods in different experiments, but their origin is still under debate. Using our egocentric path integration model we propose simple error indices depending on path geometry that will allow future experiments to rule out or corroborate certain error types. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Rats sweep their facial whiskers back and forth to generate tactile sensory information through contact with environmental structure. The neural processes operating on the signals arising from these whisker contacts are widely studied as a model of sensing in general, even though detailed knowledge of the natural circumstances under which such signals are generated is lacking. We used digital video tracking and wireless recording of mystacial electromyogram signals to assess the effects of whisker-object contact on whisking in freely moving animals exploring simple environments. Our results show that contact leads to reduced protraction (forward whisker motion) on the side of the animal ipsilateral to an obstruction and increased protraction on the contralateral side. Reduced ipsilateral protraction occurs rapidly and in the same whisk cycle as the initial contact. We conclude that whisker movements are actively controlled so as to increase the likelihood of environmental contacts while constraining such interactions to involve a gentle touch. That whisking pattern generation is under strong feedback control has important implications for understanding the nature of the signals reaching upstream neural processes.},

  abstract      = {Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) use biosonar to find insect prey in open areas, but they also find prey near vegetation and even fly through vegetation when in transit from roosts to feeding sites. To evaluate their reactions to dense, distributed clutter, bats were tested in an obstacle array consisting of rows of vertically hanging chains. Chains were removed from the array to create a curved corridor of three clutter densities (high, medium, low). Bats flew along this path to receive a food reward after landing on the far wall. Interpulse intervals (IPIs) varied across clutter densities to reflect different compromises between using short IPIs for gathering echoes rapidly enough to maneuver past the nearest chains and using longer IPIs so that all echoes from one sound can be received before the next sound is emitted. In high-clutter density, IPIs were uniformly shorter (20-65 ms) than in medium and low densities (40-100 ms) and arranged in "strobe groups," with some overlap of echo streams from different broadcasts, causing pulse-echo ambiguity. As previously proposed, alternating short and long IPIs in strobe groups may allow bats to focus on large-scale pathfinding tasks as well as close-in obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract      = {When hoarding food under infra-red light, golden hamsters Mesocricetus auratus W. return fairly directly from a feeding place to their nest site by evaluating and updating internal signals that they have generated during the previous outward journey to the feeding place. To test more specifically the animals' capacity to evaluate the linear components of the outward journey, the subjects were led from their (cone-shaped) nest to a feeding place along a detour which comprised either 2 (experiment 1) or 5 (experiment 2) segments; adjoining segments were at right angles to each other. In these conditions, the subjects remained significantly oriented towards the nest and therefore were capable of assessing translations as well as rotations during the outward journey. In experiment 3, the nest was removed after the hamsters had started the direct outward journey to the feeding place and the hamsters were rotated during the food uptake. The animals were no longer oriented towards the starting point of their journey, but nonetheless covered, along a fairly straight path, the correct homing distance, and then changed over to a circular search path. These results confirm that mammals can derive the linear components of an outward journey from self-generated signals and therefore are able to judge the homing distance without relying on cues from the environment. For a number of detour outward journeys, our data yield an unexpectedly good fit to M{\"{u}}ller and Wehner's (1988) model of dead reckoning in ants. However, this is no longer the case when the outward journey contains an initial loop which brings the subject back to the starting point. These findings are discussed in terms of the biological significance and limitations of an approximate form of path integration.},

  abstract      = {Acoustic orientation most often takes place in echoic environments. The mammalian auditory system shows a variety of specializations to suppress misleading spatial information mediated by echoes. Psychophysically these specializations are summarized as the precedence effect. This study investigates how echolocating bats deal with multiple reflections of their sonar emissions from different spatial positions. In a two-alternative, forced choice paradigm, a study was made of the extent to which the echolocating bats Megaderma lyra and Phyllostomus discolor spontaneously suppress the spatial information of a second reflection of their sonar emission. The delay between the first and the second reflection ranged between 0 and 12.8 ms. In general, M. lyra (five individuals) and P. discolor (two individuals) did not suppress the spatial information of the second reflection of their sonar emission, whatever the delay. Only one M. lyra showed significant suppression for delays between 0.8 and 3.2 ms. However, this suppression could not be confirmed in an exact repetition of the experiment. The current data indicate that although bats may be able to suppress the spatial information of a second reflection, this is not their default mode of auditory processing. The reason for this exceptional absence of spatial echo suppression may lie in the shorter time constants of cochlear processing in the ultrasonic frequency range and the strong influence of cognitive components associated with the {\textquoteleft}precedence effect{\textquoteright}.},

The analysis of the distributions of errors in the return direction and distance showed that the dogs made both systematic and random errors. They tended to overestimate by about 6 degrees the amount of turning required at the end of the outward path to take the correct return direction. Random angular errors were characterized by a standard deviation of about 9 degrees. The dogs also tended to underestimate the correct return distance by about 6\%, and random distance errors were characterized by a standard deviation of about 13\% of the correct return distance. While random errors are assumed to stem simply from inaccuracies in kinaesthetic and vestibular systems, systematic errors are likely to be generated because path integration is implemented at the neural level through approximate rather than mathematically exact solutions. A path integration model in which the moving animal is assumed to overestimate slightly the inferred motion parallax of the starting point can roughly account for the dogs' directional bias, but not for systematic errors in distance estimation.

  abstract        = {How animals, including mammals, can respond to and utilize the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation is contentious. In this study, we experimentally tested whether the Chinese Noctule, Nyctalus plancyi (Vespertilionidae) can sense magnetic field strengths that were even lower than those of the present-day geomagnetic field. Such field strengths occurred during geomagnetic excursions or polarity reversals and thus may have played an important role in the evolution of a magnetic sense. We found that in a present-day local geomagnetic field, the bats showed a clear preference for positioning themselves at the magnetic north. As the field intensity decreased to only 1/5\textsuperscript{th} of the natural intensity (i.e., 10 $\mu$T; the lowest field strength tested here), the bats still responded by positioning themselves at the magnetic north. When the field polarity was artificially reversed, the bats still preferred the new magnetic north, even at the lowest field strength tested (10 $\mu$T), despite the fact that the artificial field orientation was opposite to the natural geomagnetic field (P{\textless}0.05). Hence, N. plancyi is able to detect the direction of a magnetic field even at 1/5\textsuperscript{th} of the present-day field strength. This high sensitivity to magnetic fields may explain how magnetic orientation could have evolved in bats even as the Earth's magnetic field strength varied and the polarity reversed tens of times over the past fifty million years.},

While all students agree as to the facts reported, they disagree on theory and explanation. 5 kinds of experiments (latent learning, vicarious trial and error, searching for the stimulus, hypotheses, and spatial orientation) are described and discussed. The conditions which favor (cognitive) narrow strip-maps and which favor broad comprehensive maps in rats and in men are considered. Narrow strip-maps seem to be indicated by (1) a damaged brain, (2) an inadequate arrangement of environmentally presented cues, (3) a surplus of repetitions on the original trained-on path, and (4) the presence of too strongly frustrating conditions. The fourth point is elaborated. It is contended that some of the psychological mechanisms which clinical psychologists and other students of personality have uncovered as factors underlying many individual and social maladjustments can be interpreted "as narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or to too intense frustrations."},

  abstract        = {Path integration is a navigation strategy widely observed in nature where an animal maintains a running estimate, called the home vector, of its location during an excursion. Evidence suggests it is both ancient and ubiquitous in nature, and has been studied for over a century. In that time, canonical and neural network models have flourished, based on a wide range of assumptions, justifications and supporting data. Despite the importance of the phenomenon, consensus and unifying principles appear lacking. A fundamental issue is the neural representation of space needed for biological path integration. This paper presents a scheme to classify path integration systems on the basis of the way the home vector records and updates the spatial relationship between the animal and its home location. Four extended classes of coordinate systems are used to unify and review both canonical and neural network models of path integration, from the arthropod and mammalian literature. This scheme demonstrates analytical equivalence between models which may otherwise appear unrelated, and distinguishes between models which may superficially appear similar. A thorough analysis is carried out of the equational forms of important facets of path integration including updating, steering, searching and systematic errors, using each of the four coordinate systems. The type of available directional cue, namely allothetic or idiothetic, is also considered. It is shown that on balance, the class of home vectors which includes the geocentric Cartesian coordinate system, appears to be the most robust for biological systems. A key conclusion is that deducing computational structure from behavioural data alone will be difficult or impossible, at least in the absence of an analysis of random errors. Consequently it is likely that further theoretical insights into path integration will require an in-depth study of the effect of noise on the four classes of home vectors. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Echo classification is essential for bats' everyday life; for instance, it enables bats to use acoustical landmarks for navigation and to recognize food sources from other objects. Most of the research of echo based object classification in echo-locating bats was done in the context of simple artificial objects. These objects might represent prey, flower, or fruit and are characterized by simple echoes with a single up to several reflectors. Bats, however, must also be able to use echoes that return from complex structures such as plants or other types of background. Such echoes are characterized by superpositions of many reflections that can only be described using a stochastic statistical approach. Scientists have only lately started to address the issue of complex echo classification by echo-locating bats. Some behavioral evidence showing that bats can classify complex echoes has been accumulated and several hypotheses have been suggested as to how they do so.

  abstract      = {Mammals are able to navigate to hidden goal locations by direct routes that may traverse previously unvisited terrain. Empirical evidence suggests that this "vector navigation" relies on an internal representation of space provided by the hippocampal formation. The periodic spatial firing patterns of grid cells in the hippocampal formation offer a compact combinatorial code for location within large-scale space. Here, we consider the computational problem of how to determine the vector between start and goal locations encoded by the firing of grid cells when this vector may be much longer than the largest grid scale. First, we present an algorithmic solution to the problem, inspired by the Fourier shift theorem. Second, we describe several potential neural network implementations of this solution that combine efficiency of search and biological plausibility. Finally, we discuss the empirical predictions of these implementations and their relationship to the anatomy and electrophysiology of the hippocampal formation.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of the Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK II), a nurse-led intervention enabling caregivers to build skills based on assessment of their own needs. A total of 254 stroke caregivers (primarily female TASK II/information, support, and referral 78.0%/78.6%; white 70.7%/72.1%; about half spouses 48.4%/46.6%) were randomized to the TASK II intervention (n=123) or to an information, support, and referral group (n=131). Both groups received 8 weekly telephone sessions, with a booster at 12 weeks. General linear models with repeated measures tested efficacy, controlling for patient hospital days and call minutes. Prespecified 8-week primary outcomes were depressive symptoms (with Patient Health Questionnaire Depressive Symptom Scale PHQ-9 ≥5), life changes, and unhealthy days. Among caregivers with baseline PHQ-9 ≥5, those randomized to the TASK II intervention had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms from baseline to 8, 24, and 52 weeks and greater improvement in life changes from baseline to 12 weeks compared with the information, support, and referral group (P<0.05); but not found for the total sample. Although not sustained at 12, 24, or 52 weeks, caregivers randomized to the TASK II intervention had a relatively greater reduction in unhealthy days from baseline to 8 weeks (P<0.05). The TASK II intervention reduced depressive symptoms and improved life changes for caregivers with mild to severe depressive symptoms. The TASK II intervention reduced unhealthy days for the total sample, although not sustained over the long term. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01275495.},

The original 10-item BCOS was improved by adding five items addressing financial well-being, level of energy, role functioning, physical functioning, and general health. Psychometric testing of the revised 15-item BCOS using a sample of 147 family caregivers of stroke survivors approximately 4 months after stroke was conducted to determine the quality of the items, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity. Most caregivers were women (78.9%), White (68.0%) or African American (29.9%), and either spouses (60.1%) or adult children (31.3%). Satisfactory evidence of internal consistency (alpha = .90) and 2-week test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient [ICC] = .66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42-0.81) was provided, with item-to-total correlations ranging from .41 to .74. Unidimensionality was supported by confirmatory factor analysis with indices, indicating a good fit. Using hierarchical multiple regression, 36% of the BCOS variance was explained by constructs in the conceptual model [F(11,132) = 6.72, p < .001]. Criterion-related validity was supported by correlations with the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) General Health Subscale (r = .32, p < .001) and a criterion variable measuring how caregivers' lives had changed overall (r = .67, p < .001). The revised 15-item BCOS has evidence of satisfactory reliability and validity in family caregivers of stroke survivors. The BCOS is a valuable measure in research and can be used to identify priority areas for nursing interventions designed to improve caregivers' outcomes.},

Two studies investigated whether, despite such complexity, 10- to 11-month-old infants ( N = 16 for each study) possess skills for parsing ongoing behavior along boundaries correlated with the initiation and completion of intentions. After being familiarized with digitized sequences of continuous everyday action, infants showed renewed interest in test versions in which motion paused in the midst of an actor's pursuit of intentions (interrupting test videos). In contrast, pauses that suspended motion at intention boundary points (completing test videos) sparked no such renewed interest on infants' part. Moreover, basic salience differences between the two types of test videos were not the source of infants' increased interest when intentions were interrupted (Study 2). These findings demonstrate that infants readily detect disruptions of the structure inherent in intentional action, and hence parse ongoing behavior with respect to such structure. Such parsing skill is likely a prerequisite to the development of genuine intentional understanding.

  abstract      = {In their widely noticed study, Gergely, Bekkering, and Kir{\'{a}}ly (2002) showed that 14-month-old infants imitated an unusual action only if the model freely chose to perform this action and not if the choice of the action could be ascribed to external constraints. They attributed this kind of selective imitation to the infants' capacity of understanding the principle of rational action. In the current paper, we present evidence that a simpler approach of perceptual distraction may be more appropriate to explain their results. When we manipulated the saliency of context stimuli in the two original conditions, the results were exactly opposite to what rational imitation predicts. Based on these findings, we reject the claim that the notion of rational action plays a key role in selective imitation in 14-month-olds.},

Eighteen younger (27+/-4yr) and 15 older subjects (67+/-6yr) participated. A repeated-measures study design was used with six test conditions: one condition without AROM restrictions and five conditions with AROM restrictions (shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, fingers). AROM was restricted using customized braces. Hand function was measured using total time to complete the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function. We found that the older group took longer than the younger group to complete the Jebsen, and that restricting AROM at the elbow, forearm, wrist, or fingers resulted in decreased hand function for both groups. Because restricted AROM is a consequence of a variety of diseases and conditions, it is important to know how restricted AROM at multiple upper extremity segments affects hand function.},

However, despite the need for such assistive devices and the success of some healthcare robots, other robots have had a poor response. This article reviews the literature about human responses to healthcare robots and summarises the variables that have been found to influence responses. It may be possible to increase acceptance of healthcare robots by properly assessing the needs of the human user and then matching the robot's role, appearance and behaviour to these needs. Because robots have limitations in their abilities, another way to increase acceptance may be to modify the expectations of users to better match robots' abilities. More research needs to investigate potential users' needs and expectations in specific situations and whether interventions to increase the match between robot and human can increase acceptance.},

Infants at both ages usually simply put the mouse in the house (ignoring the hopping motion and sound effects) in the House condition, presumably because they interpreted the adult's action in terms of this final goal and so ignored the behavioral means. In contrast, infants copied the adult's action (both the hopping motion and the sound effects) when no house was present, presumably because here infants saw the action itself as the adult's only goal. From very early, infants' social learning is flexible: infants focus on and copy either the end or the means of an adult action as required by the context.},

Ten male and nine female volunteer subjects age 18 to 50 years participated; all were healthy, right dominant, with no upper limb pathology. A splint was used to restrict elbow joint motion. Three feeding tasks under both unrestricted and restricted conditions were randomly assigned; motion was recorded by a video-based three-dimensional motion analysis system. Elbow restriction resulted in significantly (p < .05) larger arcs of motion in shoulder flexion and internal rotation. Differences between feeding types were similar during both unrestricted and restricted conditions. Increased shoulder joint motion resulting from elbow joint restriction may require greater activity of shoulder girdle muscles increasing the risk of soft tissue problems and degenerative joint disease. Decisions regarding elbow immobilization should take into consideration potential effects upon total upper limb motion.},

  abstract      = {Although aging is commonly linked to a reduction in joint range of motion, it is unclear if all body joints behave similarly. To address this issue, the main purpose of this study was to compare age-related loss of mobility of seven body joints. A total of 6,000 participants (3,835 men and 2,165 women) aged 5 to 92 years took part in this study. The maximal passive range of motion of 20 movements was evaluated by Flexitest, and each movement was scored from 0 to 4. Composite scores were obtained for each of seven joints and for overall flexibility (Flexindex (FLX)) by adding individual movement scores. Confirming previous findings, FLX systematically decreased with aging (p {\textless} .001), with female participants being more flexible for all ages (p {\textless} 0.001) and having a more gradual, 0.6{\%} vs. 0.8{\%}/year, age reduction (p {\textless} .001). Starting at 30 and 40 years, respectively, for male and female participants, the relative contribution of each composite joint score to FLX dramatically changed. Shoulder contribution to FLX male's score went from 13.9{\%} at 28 years of age to only 5.2{\%} at 85 years of age. In general, proportionally, shoulder and trunk became less flexible, while elbow and knee mobility was preserved to a greater extent. Our findings indicated that age-related loss of mobility is rather joint-specific, which could be related to distinct routine usage patterns of the major body joints along life.},

  abstract      = {In the context of task sharing between a robot companion and its human partners, the notions of safe and compliant hardware are not enough. It is necessary to guarantee ergonomic robot motions. Therefore, we have developed Human Aware Manipulation Planner (Sisbot et al., 2010), a motion planner specifically designed for human-robot object transfer by explicitly taking into account the legibility, the safety and the physical comfort of robot motions. The main objective of this research was to define precise subjective metrics to assess our planner when a human interacts with a robot in an object hand-over task. A second objective was to obtain quantitative data to evaluate the effect of this interaction. Given the short duration, the "relative ease" of the object hand-over task and its qualitative component, classical behavioral measures based on accuracy or reaction time were unsuitable to compare our gestures. In this perspective, we selected three measurements based on the galvanic skin conductance response, the deltoid muscle activity and the ocular activity. To test our assumptions and validate our planner, an experimental set-up involving Jido, a mobile manipulator robot, and a seated human was proposed. For the purpose of the experiment, we have defined three motions that combine different levels of legibility, safety and physical comfort values. After each robot gesture the participants were asked to rate them on a three dimensional subjective scale. It has appeared that the subjective data were in favor of our reference motion. Eventually the three motions elicited different physiological and ocular responses that could be used to partially discriminate them. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd and the Ergonomics Society.},

It has been suggested that the choice of method could affect the results, particularly in certain groups. This study compares results attained using self-assessed and performance-based measures of upper and lower body function and vision. The influence of sex, age, education and cognitive status is explored. This is done by studying the prevalence rates of self-reported and observed limitations in function, the prevalence rates of discrepancies between measures and the prevalence rates as well as the odds ratios of discrepancies depending on sex, age, education and cognitive status. Data are from a nationally representative sample of the Swedish population aged 77 or above (n = 492). The results show that discrepancies occur among a minority of the sample and with no distinctive bias toward either under- or overestimations of functional ability at the cross-sectional level. Cognitive impairment seemed to increase the risk of discrepancies. Women showed an increased tendency toward discrepancies between measures of upper body function. Age and education showed associations with some discrepancies but were not significant in the multiple regression models. In conclusion, there is a risk of systematic biases in the association between self-assessed and performance-based measures of function. At the cross-sectional level, however, these differences are small. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

Conversely, upper-extremity function suffers from lack of objective evaluation. The present paper aims at proposing a protocol to be used to clinically and objectively evaluate upper-extremity function whatever the pathological joint. Secondly, it aims at better understanding the consequences on upper-extremity function and the compensation mechanisms induced by elbow contracture. Elbow contracture was simulated in this study by using a brace. Design Twelve healthy subjects followed an instrumented3D movement analysis while performing 11 daily life movements. The movements were performed with 3 differentelbow contracture conditions, simulated by wearing an adjustable elbow brace. Results The proposed protocol was successful in creatinga wide range of motion at all the upper-extremity joints. The activity-related range of motion and the mean range of motion computed on the whole set of daily life movements were effective in evaluating the severity of elbow contracture. The lack of elbow flexion was compensated by trunk flexion, hand flexion and radial deviation, and combined movement of shoulder flexion, abduction, and humeral internal rotation. Deficit in elbow extension was mainly compensated by the use of trunk flexion. Conclusions A protocol could be proposed for the objectiveevaluation of upper-extremity function. Its application to elbow contracture suggests that loss of elbow flexion affects more movements than loss of elbow extension.},

  abstract      = {CONTEXT: Several well-publicized recent studies have suggested that disability among older Americans has declined in the last decade. OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality, quantity, and consistency of recent evidence on US trends in the prevalence of self-rated old age disability and physical, cognitive, and sensory limitations during the late 1980s and 1990s and to evaluate the evidence on trends in disparities by major demographic groups. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and AGELINE for relevant articles published from January 1990 through May 2002 and reviewed reference lists in published articles. STUDY SELECTION: From more than 800 titles reviewed, we selected 16 articles based on 8 unique repeat cross-sectional and cohort surveys of US prevalence trends in disability or functioning among persons generally aged 65 or 70 years or older. DATA EXTRACTION: We evaluated survey quality according to 10 criteria, ranked the surveys as good, fair, or poor, and calculated for each outcome the average annual percent change. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 8 surveys, 2 were rated as good, 4 as fair, 1 as poor, and 1 as mixed (fair or poor, depending on the outcome) for assessing trends. Analyses of surveys rated fair or good showed consistency of declines in any disability (-1.55{\%} to -0.92{\%} per year), instrumental activities of daily living disability (-2.74{\%} to -0.40{\%} per year), and functional limitations. Surveys provided limited evidence on cognition and conflicting evidence on self-reported ADL (changes ranged from -1.38{\%} to 1.53{\%} per year) and vision trends. Evidence on trends in disparities by age, sex, race, and education was limited and mixed, with no consensus yet emerging. CONCLUSIONS: Several measures of old age disability and limitations have shown improvements in the last decade. Research into the causes of these improvements is needed to understand the implications for the future demand for medical care.},

  abstract      = {This article maps the range of currently held sci- entific positions on matters of concern involving social robots and older people. 345 publications from peer-reviewed jour- nals and conferences were narrowed down to 31 key publi- cations that were studied in detail and categorised into seven matters of concern: (1) role of robots in older people's lives, (2) factors affecting older people's acceptance of robots, (3) lack of mutual inspiration in the development of robots for older people, (4) robot aesthetics, (5) ethical implications of using robots in caring for older people, (6) robotic research methodology, and (7) technical determinism versus social construction of social robots. The findings indicate that older people are implicated but not present in the development of robots and that their matters of concern are not identi- fied in the design process. Instead, they are ascribed general needs of social robots due to societal changes such as age- ing demographics and demands from the healthcare industry. The conceptualisation of older people seems to be plagued with stereotypical views such as that they are lonely, frail and in need of robotic assistance. Our conclusions are that the perceptions of older people need to be re-examined and perhaps redefined in order to fairly represent who they are, and that more research on older people as social robotic users is needed.},

  abstract      = {The elbow, the middle joint of the upper limb, enables the hand to be placed at various distances from the body. The articular, muscular and neuromotor complexity of the elbow is such that it is often prone to stiffness, especially if immobilized for long periods of time. Therefore, mobilization of the posttraumatic elbow must be started early. In the presence of lesions to the ligamentous structures, the joint must be protected to prevent these structures from being placed under tension during movement. Rehabilitation of the elbow includes the use of braces. Different types of brace are used depending on clinical situation and the objectives to be achieved. They can have fixed protection or locked articulation, allow an adjustable range of movement to restrict flexion-extension and pronation-supination, or allow dynamic and static progressive movement. The latter plays a special role in conservative treatment and following surgical release. However, the effectiveness of braces in the rehabilitation treatment of elbow stiffness depends on the patient's compliance. Their use requires a considerable amount of physician time to achieve the objectives envisaged by the rehabilitation program.},

  abstract      = {Modern assistive systems, such as robots, will have increasing relevance for support at home in the future due to changes in society, such as ageing. Older people, especially, can benefit from assistive robots that give physical, cognitive and emotional support. However, thus far, little is understood of how to increase currently low acceptance of assistive robots through marketing (DAA Design Brief, Acceptance of assistive technology, 2014). Therefore, marketing strategies need to be developed addressing needs and fears of the stakeholders, which is especially critical regarding utopian-appearing assistive robots. To understand what drives acceptance, conscious and subconscious needs, wants and barriers of use of the relevant stakeholders have to be analysed. As such, in this intelligence gathering process not only end-users should be integrated. Also other stakeholders (e.g. as users, decision makers and buyers might not be identical) should be identified and their needs understood. In this paper we report our findings on marketing factors for different stakeholder clusters for assistive robots that we identified during the EU-co-funded (FP7) Robot-Era project. We employed a user-centred way of identifying stakeholders and marketing strategies by analysing different stakeholders in an iterative design process from an early stage (Mollenkopf et al., AAL in der alternden Gesellschaft: Anforderungen, Akzeptanz und Perspektiven, 2010) with quantitative and qualitative methods. The most important acceptance factors we identified for assistive robotics include functionality, usability, safety, costs and financing, (non-) stigmatization and ethical aspects. The structure of the paper is the following: first we look at the relevance of assistive robotics and the challenge of missing acceptance. We then look at the 4p concept in marketing to structure our approach of user-centered marketing. We then describe our data collection and the results to end with a discussion.

  abstract      = {Technical aids allow elderly and handicapped people to live independently and supported in their private homes for a longer time. As a contribution to such technological solutions, two demonstrator platforms for a robotic home assistant—called Care-O-bot—were designed and implemented at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart. Whereas Care-O-bot I is only a mobile platform with a touch screen, Care-O-bot II is additionally equipped with adjustable walking supporters and a manipulator arm. It has the capability to navigate autonomously in indoor environments, be used as an intelligent walking support, and execute manipulation tasks. The control software of Care-O-bot II runs on two industrial PCs and a hand-held control panel. The walking aid module is based on sensors in the walking aid handles and on a dynamic model of conventional walking aids. In “direct mode”, the user can move along freely with the robot whereas obstacles are detected and avoided. In “planned mode”, he can specify a target and be lead there by the robotic assistant. Autonomous planning and execution of complex manipulation tasks is based on a symbolic planner and environmental information provided in a database. The user input (graphical and speech input) is transferred to the task planner and adequate actions to solve the task (sequence of motion and manipulation commands) are created. A new method for sensor based manipulation using a tilting laser scanner and camera integrated in the head of the robot has been implemented. Additional sensors in the robot hand increase the grasping capabilities. The walking aid has been tested with elderly users from an assisted living facility and a nursery home. Furthermore, the execution of fetch and carry tasks has been implemented and tested in a sample home environment.},

  abstract      = {Service robotics is an emerging application area for human-centered technologies. The rise of household and personal assistance robots forecasts a human-robot collaborative society. One of the robotics community's major task is to streamline development trends, work on the harmonization of taxonomies and ontologies, along with the standardization of terms, interfaces and technologies. It is important to keep the scientific progress and public understanding synchronous, through efficient outreach and education. These efforts support the collaboration among research groups, and lead to widely accepted standards, beneficial for both manufacturers and users. This article describes the necessity of developing robotics ontologies and standards focusing on the past and current research efforts. In addition, the paper proposes a roadmap for service robotics ontology development. The IEEE Robotics {\&} Automation Society is sponsoring the working group Ontologies for Robotics and Automation. The efforts of the Working group are presented here, aiming to connect the cutting edge technology with the users of these services - the general public. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our work focuses on the use of social robotic technologies to provide person-centered cognitive interventions. In this article, we investigate the acceptance and attitudes of older adults toward the human-like expressive socially assistive robot Brian 2.1 in order to determine if the robot�{\_}Ts human-like assistive and social characteristics would promote the use of the robot as a cognitive and social interaction tool to aid with activities of daily living. The results of a robot acceptance questionnaire administered during a robot demonstration session with a group of 46 elderly adults showed that the majority of the individuals had positive attitudes toward the socially assistive robot and its intended applications},

  abstract      = {The future paths of population ageing result from specific combinations of declining fertility and increasing life expectancies in different parts of the world. Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account, the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88{\%}, somewhat higher than previously assessed. After mid-century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing.},

  abstract      = {Deferred imitation after a 1-week delay was examined in 14-month-old infants. Six actions, each using a different object, were demonstrated to each infant. One of the six actions was a novel behavior that had a zero probability of occurrence in spontaneous play. In the imitation condition, infants observed the demonstration but were not allowed to touch the objects, thus preventing any immedi- ate imitation. After the 1-week delay, infants returned to the laboratory and their imitation of the adult's previous actions was scored. Infants in the imitation condition produced significantly more of the target actions than infants in control groups who were not exposed to the modeling; there was also strong evidence for the imitation of the novel act. From a cognitive perspective deferred imita- tion provides a means of assessing recall memory and representation in children. From a social- developmental viewpoint the findings illustrate that the behavioral repertoire of infants and their knowledge about objects can expand as a result of seeing the actions of others. Developmental theories differ in the extent to which imita- tion is viewed as making a contribution to the growth of a child's behavioral repertoire. Piaget(1952,1954) tended to em- phasize individual discovery and to minimize social imitation as a mechanism for acquiring new behaviors. Conversely, Ban- dura (1969, 1986) highlighted imitation as a channel for learn- ing in school-age children, and Meltzoff (1985, 1988a, 1988b, in press) has emphasized the powerful influence of imitation in infancy. Regardless of the differing perspectives on the function of imitation, there is broad agreement that infants' ability to perform imitation after a delay, and especially deferred imita- tion of novel behaviors, is a milestone achievement both from a cognitive and a social perspective (Bandura, 1986;Flavell, 1985; Meltzoff, 1988b; Piaget, 1962). The acquisition of new behav- iors through observation, particularly when they can delay pro- duction until significantly later, potentially provides both an av- enue for social learning and a nonverbal measure of memory and representation. Although imitation after a delay has been actively investi- gated in school-age children (Bandura, Grusec, {\&} Menlove, 1966; Bandura {\&} Walters, 1963), there have been only a few such experimental investigations in infants. McCall, Parke, and Kavanaugh (1977) reported imitation after a 1-day delay in 26- month-old subjects. Meltzoff (1985) found deferred imitation of a simple action after a 1-day delay in 14-month-olds. Re- cently, it has been reported that infants as young as 9 months This research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (HD-22514) and the MacAr- thur Foundation.

The comparison of younger (under 25 years), adult (26-50 years), and elderly groups (older than 51 years), found that: (1) in the younger age group, images of robots are ambiguous about near future assumptions, preferences, and antipathy, (2) the adult group assumes that communication robots will appear in the near future, but actually expects robots to function in non-communication tasks such as household duties and dangerous tasks, and experiences great anxiety and fear about social relationships between robots and humans, (3) the elderly group assumes that both communication and non-communication robots will appear in the near future, but actually expects robots to function in communication tasks such as service in public settings and providing care at home or in welfare facilities, and is very concerned about the physical and ecological damage that robots may cause. Although the pilot study had a problem of sample bias on participant selection and distributions of gender and age, it can lead to some predictions on social acceptance of robots in Japan.},

The current study directly investigated two different theoretical notions employing the seminal and widely used head touch paradigm. In two conditions, we manipulated whether the action appeared to be efficient while motor resonance was optimized to enhance imitation performance in general. The results showed that infants imitated the target action to the same extent in both conditions irrespective of the action's efficiency. In addition, in both conditions, more infants imitated the head action than in an additional baseline condition or in a condition where the target action was performed by another effector. The results suggest that 14-month-olds do not imitate novel actions according to their apparent efficiency but that motor resonance is an important factor in infants' imitation.},

The principle of rational action suggests that infants normatively evaluate the efficiency of observed actions. In contrast, it has been proposed that motor resonance (i.e., the mapping of others' actions onto one's own motor repertoire) plays a central role in imitation. This study tested 14-month-old infants (n = 95) in 5 conditions and manipulated the extent to which the observed actions could be matched onto the infants' own motor repertoire as well as whether the observed behavior appeared to be efficient.

  abstract      = {Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) may help improve care delivery at home for older adults with cognitive impairment and reduce the burden of informal caregivers. Examining the views of these stakeholders on SAR is fundamental in order to conceive acceptable and useful SAR for dementia care. This study investigated SAR acceptance among three groups of older adults living in the community: persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, and healthy older adults. Different technology acceptance questions related to the robot and user characteristics, potential applications, feelings about technology, ethical issues, and barriers and facilitators for SAR adoption, were addressed in a mixed-method study. Participants (n = 25) completed a survey and took part in a focus group (n = 7). A functional robot prototype, a multimedia presentation, and some use-case scenarios provided a base for the discussion. Content analysis was carried out based on recorded material from focus groups. Results indicated that an accurate insight of influential factors for SAR acceptance could be gained by combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of SAR for supporting care at home for individuals with cognitive impairment. In all the three groups, intention to use SAR was found to be lower for the present time than that anticipated for the future. However, caregivers and persons with MCI had a higher perceived usefulness and intention to use SAR, at the present time, than healthy older adults, confirming that current needs are strongly related to technology acceptance and should influence SAR design. A key theme that emerged in this study was the importance of customizing SAR appearance, services, and social capabilities. Mismatch between needs and solutions offered by the robot, usability factors, and lack of experience with technology, were seen as the most important barriers for SAR adoption.},

  abstract      = {Interpersonal or multiagent coordination is a common part of everyday human activity. Identifying the dynamic processes that shape and constrain the complex , time -evolving patterns of multiagent behavioral coordination often requires the development of dynamical models to test hypotheses and motivate future research questions . Here we review a task dynamic framework for modeling multiagent behavior and illustrate the application of this f ramework using two examples. With an emphasis on synergistic self- orga niz ation, we demonstrate how the behavioral coordination that character izes many social acti vities emerge s natural ly from the physical, informational, and biomechanical constrain ts and couplings that exist between two or more environmental ly embedded and mutually responsive individuals .},

Infants watched as an adult made a toy animal use a particular action to get to an endpoint. In 1 condition there was a barrier that prevented a more straightforward action and so gave the actor no choice but to use the demonstrated action. In the other condition there was no barrier, so the actor had a free choice to use the demonstrated action or not. Twelve-month-olds showed the same pattern of results as in Gergely and colleagues’ study: They copied the particular action demonstrated more often when the adult freely chose to use the action than when she was forced to use it. Twelve-month-olds, too, thus show an understanding of others’ intentions as rational choices and can use this understanding in cultural learning contexts. When},

  abstract      = {Background: Elbow contractures can be functionally debilitating. Extensive research has been published on treatments to restore elbow motion, but few have discussed clinical implications beyond the affected extremity. Reciprocal arm swing in normal gait has been shown to increase stability and reduce energy expenditure. The importance of arm swing has been clinically demonstrated in patients with cerebral palsy, stroke and Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that elbow contractures would result in an abnormal spatio-temporal gait parameters. Methods: Forty volunteer subjects walked on the Gaitmat II which provided real-time analysis of temporal and distance gait parameters. Five conditions were tested: no brace (control 1), elbow brace unlocked (control 2) and brace locked in 30??, 90?? or 120?? flexion (simulating fixed elbow contractures). Condition order was randomized for each subject. Each condition consisted of five walking trials. Results: All three fixed elbow conditions (120??, 90?? and 30??) demonstrated significantly decreased gait velocity (1.37, 1.39 and 1.39. m/s) and stride length (1.45, 1.46 and 1.46. m) compared to the control condition (1.42. m/s and 1.48. m, respectively). Single limb stance and double support times were decreased and increased, respectively, compared to control. There was no significant difference in cadence or limb asymmetry in the three fixed elbow conditions. Conclusions: Despite well-established functional limitations in elbow contracture patients and importance of arm swing in normal gait, the impact of elbow contractures on gait is unknown. This study demonstrates that simulated elbow contracture results in significant differences in spatio-temporal gait parameters suggesting that elbow contractures have a broader functional impact beyond the affected extremity.

  abstract      = {How might one account for the organization in behavior without attributing it to an internal control structure? The present article develops a theoretical framework called behavioral dynamics that integrates an information-based approach to perception with a dynamical systems approach to action. For a given task, the agent and its environment are treated as a pair of dynamical systems that are coupled mechanically and informationally. Their interactions give rise to the behavioral dynamics, a vector field with attractors that correspond to stable task solutions, repellers that correspond to avoided states, and bifurcations that correspond to behavioral transitions. The framework is used to develop theories of several tasks in which a human agent interacts with the physical environment, including bouncing a ball on a racquet, balancing an object, braking a vehicle, and guiding locomotion. Stable, adaptive behavior emerges from the dynamics of the interaction between a structured environment and an agent with simple control laws, under physical and informational constraints.},

Motor patterns are understood as a reflection of stability properties in a complex dynamical system, such as phase attraction and repulsion, bifurcation, and meta-stability. Moreover, the observation that similar coordination phenomena occur between visually coupled and neurally coupled oscillatory systems, from a swarm of Malaysian fireflies to the limbs of two people, led Scott to the view that coordination dynamics is fundamentally informational rather than physical in nature [29, 30].},

  abstract      = {Studies on rational imitation have provided evidence for the fact that infants as young as 12 months of age engage in rational imitation. However, the developmental onset of this ability is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether 9- and 12-month-olds detect voluntary and implicit as well as nonvoluntary and explicit constraints in the head touch task. Three groups of infants watched video sequences, which displayed a person illuminating a lamp using the head. The hands of the model were either free, occupied by voluntarily holding a blanket, or nonvoluntarily restrained by being tied to the table. An additional control group of infants watched the model turning on the lamp by using the hand. Given that the majority of infants imitated the head touch when the model's hands were free, there was evidence for rational imitation in comparison to the condition in which the model's hands were tied to the table, but not in comparison to the condition in which the hands were occupied by holding a blanket. Nine-month-olds showed no differences in their behavior according to the condition. These findings clarify the onset of rational imitation by showing that 12-month-olds (but not 9-month-olds) take into account a situational constraint only when the constraint is nonvoluntary and explicit. },

The goal of this study was to explore the acceptability and usability of a remote presence robot (RPR) in a simulated primary care wellness encounter for older adults. A descriptive exploratory study was used to determine the acceptability and usability of the RPR operated by an APRN 250 miles from 13 older adults residing in a high rise during a simulated primary care visit. The results support previous research that technology such as the RPR can be both acceptable and useful for an older adult and primary care provider but only in certain circumstances.},

  abstract        = {There is a growing shortage of nursing graduates and faculty to prepare students for careers in nursing. One way to ameliorate this paradigm is to integrate technology such as a remote presence robot (RPR) in both clinical and educational settings. The InTouch Health (Santa Barbara, CA) RP-7, an RPR, was deployed in a simulated, multigenerational home where nursing students and faculty interact in a variety of activities. Seventy students and five faculty members were instructed by a remotely located instructor who controlled the RP-7 from a distant site. Students and faculty, using questionnaires, provided feedback on the didactic interaction. Of the 70 student participants, 56 (80%) responded, and faculty and clinical staff were 100% compliant, resulting in 69 total respondents. Using Krippendorf's themes of (1) usefulness, (2) acceptability, and (3) impact, the data indicated the following. The majority of the students (89%) had no previous experience with the RPR, but the majority (75%) felt that the RPR was a good faculty extender. The students were initially evenly split on first exposure in (a) a positive experience, (b) a negative experience, or (c) a mixed experience. Although there were some technical challenges in operations, these were not deemed significant; nevertheless, they must be addressed. The results of this study support the use of RPRs as faculty extenders to facilitate course quality assurance when the lead faculty is not on site. Both faculty and students perceive this type of technology as a potential faculty extender, but both faculty and students need preparation for the experience.},

Mercy's leaders therefore decided that the hospital could offer cultural-specific programs that better meet the healthcare needs of these populations. To secure residents' perspective, an assessment process was launched. The data gathered from participants in face-to-face interviews revealed that some had problems with access to healthcare. A lack of money and other resources seemed to be the major barriers to care. The key concern of the elderly persons interviewed is securing personalized care or services that help them maintain their independence. A number of participants wanted free transportation (other than to and from the hospital). They need help getting to their physician's office, the pharmacy, the grocery store, and the bank. Public agencies may offer such transportation services. In addition, the Hispanic elderly interviewed would like to see Spanish-speaking personnel in admissions and the emergency department.},

A multidisciplinary team of professionals from both hospitals decided that a membership program (titled the Senior Advantage Program) would be the most effective way to market the services and make them available. As part of the program's development, professionals from the two facilities created a personal computer-based software package that enabled them to capture and update information about Senior Advantage participants. The software program includes a detailed application form and a section for recording enrollees' service utilization. The program enables care givers to enter data when they interact with clients in any healthcare or community-based setting. To complement the personal computer software, a program to construct a central data base was written for the two hospitals' main computer systems. In 1991 St. Charles and Mercy hospitals joined two other facilities to form First InterHealth Network, a for-profit integrated delivery network. The Senior Advantage Program became the basis for the first package of services offered by First InterHealth. In 1992 the program became the catalyst for yet another collaborative venture, linking two rural Ohio Mercy hospitals to St. Charles and Mercy hospitals. The expanded network encouraged rural patients to remain within the Mercy network, utilizing inner-city and suburban Mercy-sponsored hospitals when appropriate.},

  abstract        = {It is often assumed that navigation implies the use, by animals, of landmarks indicating the location of the goal. However, many animals (including humans) are able to return to the starting point of a journey, or to other goal sites, by relying on self-motion cues only. This process is known as path integration, and it allows an agent to calculate a route without making use of landmarks. We review the current literature on path integration and its interaction with external, location-based cues. Special importance is given to the correlation between observable behavior and the activity pattern of particular neural cell populations that implement the internal representation of space. In mammals, the latter may well be the first high-level cognitive representation to be understood at the neural level.},

It appears that viewpoint-specific visual information (e.g. landmarks) becomes secondarily bound to this structure by associative learning. These associations between landmarks and the preconfigured path integrator serve to set the origin for path integration and to correct for cumulative error. In the absence of familiar landmarks, or in darkness without a prior spatial reference, the system appears to adopt an initial reference for path integration independently of external cues. A hypothesis of how the path integration system may operate at the neuronal level is proposed.},

  abstract      = {Bat echolocation is an ability consisting of many subtasks such as navigation, prey detection and object recognition. Understanding the echolocation capabilities of bats comes down to isolating the minimal set of acoustic cues needed to complete each task. For some tasks, the minimal cues have already been identified. However, while a number of possible cues have been suggested, little is known about the minimal cues supporting obstacle avoidance in echolocating bats. In this paper, we propose that the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) and travel time of the first millisecond of the echo train are sufficient cues for obstacle avoidance. We describe a simple control algorithm based on the use of these cues in combination with alternating ear positions modeled after the constant frequency bat Rhinolophus rouxii. Using spatial simulations (2D and 3D), we show that simple phonotaxis can steer a bat clear from obstacles without performing a reconstruction of the 3D layout of the scene. As such, this paper presents the first computationally explicit explanation for obstacle avoidance validated in complex simulated environments. Based on additional simulations modelling the FM bat Phyllostomus discolor, we conjecture that the proposed cues can be exploited by constant frequency (CF) bats and frequency modulated (FM) bats alike. We hypothesize that using a low level yet robust cue for obstacle avoidance allows bats to comply with the hard real-time constraints of this basic behaviour.},

  abstract      = {? 2016 Warnecke, Lee, Krishnan and Moss.Animals rely on sensory feedback from their environment to guide locomotion. For instance, visually guided animals use patterns of optic flow to control their velocity and to estimate their distance to objects (e.g., Srinivasan et al., 1991, 1996). In this study, we investigated how acoustic information guides locomotion of animals that use hearing as a primary sensory modality to orient and navigate in the dark, where visual information is unavailable. We studied flight and echolocation behaviors of big brown bats as they flew under infrared illumination through a corridor with walls constructed from a series of individual vertical wooden poles. The spacing between poles on opposite walls of the corridor was experimentally manipulated to create dense/sparse and balanced/imbalanced spatial structure. The bats? flight trajectories and echolocation signals were recorded with high-speed infrared motion-capture cameras and ultrasound microphones, respectively. As bats flew through the corridor, successive biosonar emissions returned cascades of echoes from the walls of the corridor. The bats flew through the center of the corridor when the pole spacing on opposite walls was balanced and closer to the side with wider pole spacing when opposite walls had an imbalanced density. Moreover, bats produced shorter duration echolocation calls when they flew through corridors with smaller spacing between poles, suggesting that clutter density influences features of the bat?s sonar signals. Flight speed and echolocation call rate did not, however, vary with dense and sparse spacing between the poles forming the corridor walls. Overall, these data demonstrate that bats adapt their flight and echolocation behavior dynamically when flying through acoustically complex environments.},

  abstract      = {We compared the flight and echolocation behaviour of a vespertilionid bat (Myotis nattereri) approaching a large stationary or a small moving target. Bats were trained to either land on a landing grid or to catch a moving tethered mealworm. When closing in on these two targets, the bats emitted groups of sounds with increasing number of signals and decreasing pulse interval and duration. When pursuing the mealworm, the approach phase always ended with a terminal group consisting of buzz I and buzz II. When landing, the bats emitted either a terminal group consisting of buzz I alone, with one or two extra pulses, or a group consisting of buzz I and buzz II. In all situations, buzz I ended on average between 47-63 ms prior to contact with the target of interest, which is approximately the reaction time of bats. Therefore, the information collected in buzz II does not guide the bats to the target. The relevant part of the approach phase to reach the target ends with buzz I. The basic sound pattern of this part is rather similar and independent of whether the bats approach the large stationary or the small moving target.},

  abstract      = {Trawling bats use echolocation not only to detect and classify acoustically continuous cues originated from insects at and above water surfaces, but also to detect small water-dwelling prey items breaking the water surface for a very short time, producing only transient cues to be perceived acoustically. Generally, bats need to adjust their echolocation behavior to the specific task on hand, and because of the diversity of prey cues they use in hunting, trawling bats should be highly flexible in their echolocation behavior. We studied the adaptations in the behavior of Noctilio leporinus when approaching either a continuous cue or a transient cue that disappeared during the approach of the bat. Normally the bats reacted by dipping their feet in the water at the cue location. We found that the bats typically started to adapt their calling behavior at approximately 410 ms before prey contact in continuous cue trials, but were also able to adapt their approach behavior to stimuli onsets as short as 177 ms before contact, within a minimum reaction time of 50.9 ms in response to transient cues. In both tasks the approach phase ended between 32 and 53 ms before prey contact. Call emission always continued after the end of the approach phase until around prey contact. In some failed capture attempts, call emission did not cease at all after prey contact. Probably bats used spatial memory to dip at the original location of the transient cue after its disappearance. The duration of the pointed dips was significantly longer in transient cue trials than in continuous cue trials. Our results suggest that trawling bats possess the ability to modify their generally rather stereotyped echolocation behavior during approaches within very short reaction times depending on the sensory information available.},
